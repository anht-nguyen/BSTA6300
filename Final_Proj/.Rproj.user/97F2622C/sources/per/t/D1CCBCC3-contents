# Categorical Data Analysis (Limit to no more than 2 pages, excluding figures and tables)
• Perform simple association test and interpret the results.

• Construct a simple generalized linear regression model

## Some notes
Association test: (e.g. association between treatment and response, Lec 21) using contingency tables

GLM in this section differs from the Linear Model section, which asking to find the association between continous variables. 

Do logistic regression for binary outcome variable. In this data, what outcome variable is binary? Individual weight loss? Binary outcome can be: losing weight vs not losing weight (wgt_change negative vs >= 0)

- wgt loss status vs.: intervention condition, gender, clinical site, race, education, marital, smoking, drinking

## Perform simple association test
Create a new column: "losing wgt" (1) for wgt_change < 0 and "not losing wgt" (0) for wgt_change >= 0
```{r}
# # library(tibble)
# included.data <- included.data %>% add_column(Losing_Wgt_Status = if_else(.$wgt_change < 0, "Losing Weight", "Not Losing Weight"))
# included.data <- included.data %>% add_column(Losing_Wgt = if_else(.$wgt_change < 0, 1, 0))
```


Contingency table: association between wgt loss status vs intervention condition

```{r}
addmargins(table(included.data$Condition, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
Expected = c(90*108, 76*108, 90*58, 76*58) / 166
matrix(Expected, nrow =2 ) # no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$Condition, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```
No significant difference between losing weight status between 2 intervention groups

```{r, losing_weight vs. gender}
addmargins(table(included.data$Gender, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
Expected = c(108*26, 108*140, 58*26, 58*140) / 166
matrix(Expected, nrow =2 ) # no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$Gender, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```

No association between gender and losing weight


```{r, losing_weight vs. clinical site}
addmargins(table(included.data$Site, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$Site, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$Site, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
(p.site1 <- 24/38)
(p.site2 <- 36/44)
(p.site3 <- 25/40)
(p.site4 <- 13/20)
(p.site5 <- 10/24)
```

Proportions of people losing wgt in different sites are different. Most people in site 2 lost weight, while least people in site 5 lost weight.


```{r, losing_weight vs race}
addmargins(table(included.data$Race, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$Race, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# 2/8 cells have expected values less than 5, and 1 cell has value <1 => Use Fisher's exact test

fisher.test(table(included.data$Race, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status), simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```

No association between race and losing weight status

```{r, losing wgt vs education}
addmargins(table(included.data$Education, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$Education, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$Education, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```
No association between education level and losing weight

```{r, losing_wgt vs marital status}
addmargins(table(included.data$Marital, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$Marital, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$Marital, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```
No association between marital status and losing weight

```{r, losing weight vs smoking}
addmargins(table(included.data$smoker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$smoker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$smoker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```
No association between current tobacco use and losing weight

```{r, losing weight vs drinking}
addmargins(table(included.data$drinker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
chisq.test(table(included.data$drinker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))$expected
# no cell have expected value <5 => use Chi-squared test for association

chisq.test(table(included.data$drinker, included.data$Losing_Wgt_Status))
```

No association between current tobacco use and losing weight




## Construct a simple generalized linear regression model
Do logistic regression for categorical outcomes (binary or dichotomous)

Incorporate multiple predictors to control them in testing association with outcome (Losing_Wgt_Status)

Also do: multiple linear regression for. wgt_change (continous outcome) vs continuous variables (height, age, wgt_base, ...)
Higher-way ANOVA for wgt_change vs intervention condition +  categorical variables (above + nonparamentric variables like month and comorbid)

https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/12/linear-mixed-effect-models-in-r/


```{r, multiple logistic regression}

model.log <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~ wgt_base + age + height, data = included.data)
summary(model.log)

```

```{r, linear mixed (continous+categorical, hypothesized predicted should be included) model for ANOVA}

```
```{r, higher-way ANOVA}

```


Linear mixed-model can be overkill here...

```{r}
glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~ Condition + Gender + age + Site + height + wgt_base + month + comorbid + Education + Marital + Tobacco + Alcohol, family = binomial, data = included.data)
summary(glm_wgt_chng)

glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~ age + height + Alcohol, family = binomial, data = included.data)
summary(glm_wgt_chng)
```

```{r}
glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~  Gender + age + Site + height + wgt_base + month + comorbid + Education + Marital + Tobacco + Alcohol, family = binomial, data = included.data[included.data$tx == "0", ])
summary(glm_wgt_chng)

glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~  Gender + age + Site + height + wgt_base + month + comorbid + Education + Marital + Tobacco + Alcohol, family = binomial, data = included.data[included.data$tx == "1", ])
summary(glm_wgt_chng)
```
```{r}
glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~  Gender + Tobacco + Alcohol, family = binomial, data = included.data[included.data$tx == "0", ])
summary(glm_wgt_chng)

glm_wgt_chng <- glm(Losing_Wgt ~  Gender  + height + wgt_base + Tobacco , family = binomial, data = included.data[included.data$tx == "1", ])
summary(glm_wgt_chng)
```
