# Linear Model (Limit to no more than 2 pages, excluding figures and tables)

• Construct linear model(s) to answer ONE OR MORE of the research questions of interest.

• Justify the procedures or reasons for model and variable selection.

• Fit the model and interpret parameter estimates and confidence intervals if applicable.

• Do model diagnosis using graphical and statistical tools and discuss appropriate remedy procedures if needed.

## Research Questions

-   which factors predict better outcome (weight change/loss)? 

Variables to be tested: baseline weight, month, 

Other candidates: demographics variables eg, age, ethnic, height, etc.


## Some notes
We can start with some linear fitting figure to get a sense of relationship between variables

Linear model: between 2 continuous variables

ANOVA: relationship between 1 continuous variables and 1 categorical

Both categorical vars: contingency table (will look at this in Categorical Analysis)

Multiple regression 

How about controlling confounding factors? 
  Multiple-regression analysis allows us to identify which few variables among a large set of independent variables have a significant relationship to the dependent variable after adjusting for other important variables.

Also need to check goodness-of-fit for linear models

### Figures
```{r}
xyplot(wgt_change ~ age | Condition , data = included.data)

xyplot(wgt_change ~ wgt_base | Condition , data = included.data)

xyplot(wgt_change ~ height | Condition , data = included.data)

xyplot(wgt_change ~ month | Condition , data = included.data)

xyplot(wgt_change ~ comorbid | Condition , data = included.data)

```


## Build a multi regression model
Continuous variables: baseline weight, month (not normal), height, comorbid (not normal), age 

Fit the linear model
```{r, control group}
(linear.m0 <- lm(wgt_change ~ wgt_base + age + height, data = included.data[included.data$tx==0,], x = TRUE))
anova(linear.m0)
```

No evidence of strong linear relationship
Anova: fail to reject H0: all betas = 0

```{r, intervention group}
(linear.m1 <- lm(wgt_change ~ wgt_base + age + height, data = included.data[included.data$tx==1,], x = TRUE))
anova(linear.m1)
```
No evidence of strong linear relationship
Anova: fail to reject H0: all betas = 0


## ANOVA: weight change (cont) vs intervention + a categorical variable 

Actually we can use 2-way ANCOVA to control covariates, such as difference in obesity between race/ethnicity or gender.

```{r}
mod1 = lm(wgt_change ~ Condition * Gender, data = included.data)
plot(mod1, which = 2)
wgt_chgn_aov1 <- aov(mod1)
summary(wgt_chgn_aov1)

```
```{r}
mod1 = lm(wgt_change ~ Condition * Race, data = included.data)
plot(mod1, which = 2)
wgt_chgn_aov1 <- aov(mod1)
summary(wgt_chgn_aov1)
```
```{r}
mod1 = lm(wgt_change ~ Condition * Marital, data = included.data)
plot(mod1, which = 2)
plot(mod1, add.smooth = FALSE, which = 3)
wgt_chgn_aov1 <- aov(mod1)
summary(wgt_chgn_aov1)
```

```{r}
mod1 = lm(wgt_change ~ Condition * Tobacco, data = included.data)
